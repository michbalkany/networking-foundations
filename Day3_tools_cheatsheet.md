ping - Checks if your device is reachable and how long it takes to reply

tracerout /tracert - shows the path your data takes across the internet to reach its destination

ip or ifconfig - shows your device's IP address and network setup

netstat or ss - Shows open connections and what apps are using the network

dig or nslookup - Looks up DNS info - like turning a domain name into an IP address

tcpdump - sniffs all the network traffic your device can see - like a packet level spy cam

whois - Finds out who registered a domain or IP - sort of like peeking at their internet business card.


Tool		Notes
ping	    Use ping -c 4 to limit count
traceroute	May need to install with sudo apt install traceroute
ip		    ip addr show is modern replacement
ifconfig	Run sudo apt install net-tools if missing
netstat	    Try ss -tuln insteadâ€”it's modern
ss	        Preferred over netstat on modern distros
dig		    If not installed: sudo apt install dnsutils
nslookup	Part of dnsutils
tcpdump		Run with sudo
whois		If missing: sudo apt install whois

 ## The line above ^^^^^ is my VM asking the local DNS server @ 192.168.113.2 "Who owns the IP 192.168.113.128" PTR records are used for reverse DNS lookups, most of the time by, security software to attach domain names to IPs

## The two lines above are ARP Requests and replies. Device 192.168.113.2 is trying to find the MAC address of my VM. My VM then replies with its virtual MAC: 00:0c:29:f5:16:04

# What these results show, is the entire local subnet (192.168.113 -192.168.113.255) to see which devices are currently online AKA a ping sweep.

# I discovered 4 active devices on the local network:
192.168.113.1 -- this is the virtual router or gateway. it handles traffic n/out of my VM

192.168.113.2 -- A VMware virtual service or my host. MAC shows its part of VMware.

192.168.113.254 -- Another VMware virtual network device which could be DHCP or NAT service

192.168.113.128 -- this is my Kali linux VM itself, the actual machine that is running the scan.

# How would a white hat hacker be able to use these tools on a day to day job?

# Ping - Checks if the target is reachable before scanning or exploiting it.

# traceroute - Map the path to a target server, find network chokepoints or ISP leaks.

# ip/ifconfig - checks IP and interface details before launching an attack or scan from the right interface.

# netstat/ss - See what service are running on a system during post-exploitation 

# nslookup - Gathers DNS intel such as subdomains, mail servers, or internal naming conventions AKA footpringting

# tcpdump - Captures credentials, cookies, or sensitive data from unencrypted traffic duirng sniffing.

# nmap -sn -- discovers live hosts to scan further- stage 1 of a network scan

# arp -a -- identifies all devices on a LAN and spot possible spoofing or rogue entries.

During a penetration test, you would use-- 
nmap -sn to locate targets --> then verify their presence with ping --> use tcpdump to sniff open wifi-traffic --> leverage nslookup/dig to find admin panel subdomains --> use netstat to find services like SSH MySQL to exploit.
